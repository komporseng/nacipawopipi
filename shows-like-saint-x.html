<time>05 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The plot of “Saint X” centres on Claire Thomas, a young lady whose traumatic history drives her to seek explanations. ‘Saint X’ is a television series directed by <a href=#>Leila</a> Gerstein that tells the tale of the Thomas family, who go on holiday in the Caribbean Sea fifteen years before Claire starts looking for them. The family’s peaceful vacation quickly turns sour when the older daughter of the home disappears on the final day of the trip. The psychological drama on Hulu centres on Claire’s quest for closure and the truth and is based on Alexis Schaitkin’s book of the same name.</p><p>The drama series, starring West Duchovny, Alycia Debnam-Carey, Josh Bonzie, Jayden Elijah, and Betsy Brandt, takes a variety of unexpected turns that emphasise the internalised pain that can be impossible to overcome. So, if the enigmatic premise of “Saint X” piqued your interest, here is a list of comparable television programmes. Several of these programmes, including “Saint X,” are available on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>A Confession (2019)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a-confession.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=512 height=220 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Based on the real-life experiences of DSU Stephen Fulcher, “A Confession” depicts a detective’s pursuit of justice and rectification of the past. Detective Stephen Fulcher sets out to find the legendary killer who murdered a missing woman while putting his job and reputation on the line. Martin Freeman, Siobhan Finneran, Imelda Staunton, Joe Absolom, and Faye McKeever are among the cast members. This series, like “Saint X,” dramatises a tragic and real occurrence, making it the ideal programme to watch after that.</p><h3>Five Days (2007-2010)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/five-days-1.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=450 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Five Days’ tells the tale of a young mother travelling to a routine visit with her grandfather and features Suranne Jones, Hugh Bonneville, Janet McTeer, Penelope Wilton, Lee Massey, David Oyelowo, and Michelle Bonnard. She stops at a flower truck on the highway, but then mysteriously vanishes. The show centres on the plight of the mother of two young children and her husband, who have been abandoned in the confusion, as it follows the investigation into her abduction.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u23f0680beac87741307a9a7def61f1e1><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 shows like normal people</span></a><p>This BBC television programme, which was created by Gwyneth Hughes, explores similar ideas to those in “Saint X,” such as sudden disappearances and unsolved questions. Like “Saint X,” the programme also has a remarkable mystery that leads to a lot of unexpected disclosures.</p><h3>Safe (2018)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Safe_TV_Miniseries-730170981-large.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=512 height=320 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Safe’ centres on British Tom Delaney, a paediatric physician and father of two teenage children, and stars Michael C. Hall, Amanda Abbington, Audrey Fleurot, and Marc Warren. Briton has a hard time connecting with his daughter after losing his wife to cancer a year ago. But when his sixteen-year-old cousin mysteriously vanishes, he discovers a web of secrets as he desperately searches for her to make sure she is safe.</p><p>The miniseries addresses a variety of additional topics that are also present in “Saint X,” in addition to a mystery disappearance. For instance, the show depicts a disappearance that occurs within a gated <a href=#>community</a> that is similar to the safe holiday destination of the Thomas family. ‘Safe’ also depicts a family member’s search for the truth, which is a major theme in ‘Saint X.’</p><h3>Sharp Objects (2018)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sharp-Objects_11zon.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=512 height=342 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sharp Objects, starring Amy Adams as the title character, tells the tale of crime writer Camille Preaker as she sets out to look into the grisly death of two young children in her community. Camille sets off on a difficult trip, but her prior traumas and self-harming behaviours keep making it more difficult for her to learn the truth.</p><p>Eliza Scanlen, Patricia Clarkson, Chris Messina, and Sydney Sweeney are also present in the series. The author of the psychological suspense is Marti Noxon. So, if you like “Saint X” and Claire’s unwavering pursuit of the truth, you’ll enjoy Camille’s investigation’s unfolding mystery just as much.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua940c06edb637ba03b9a3f553252af64><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>8 Shows Like Lucky Hank That Will Have You Hooked from the First Episode</span></a><h3>The Killing (2011-2014)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-killing.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=464 height=262 sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mireille Enos, Joel Kinnaman, Peter Sarsgaard, Billy Campbell, Michelle Forbes, and Brent Sexton star in the film “The Killing,” which is based on the Danish television series. The programme centres on Rosie Larsen, a 17-year-old who is the subject of an intersectional investigation. While a young woman’s unexplained death keeps the police on their toes, a concurrent Seattle mayoral campaign and a resentful family both play a significant role in figuring out what really happened to the young woman. This is the ideal programme to watch next because it was created by Veena Sud and mirrors the search for the truth that was depicted in “Saint X”!</p><h3>The Lørenskog Disappearance (2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Lorenskog-Disappearance-Ending-Explained-Jorunn-Lakke.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Lrenskog Disappearance, a fiction based on a genuine disappearance, tells the tale of Anne Elisabeth Hagen, the millionaire’s wife, whose disappearance causes a commotion. The Norwegian drama series delves into the tangled personal lives of the characters, the flawed police investigation, and the ensuing accusations over the husband’s involvement in the case.</p><p>The actors in the series include Yngvild Sten Grotmol, Jorunn Lakke, Kidane Gjlme Dalva, Micael Delvir, Christian Rubeck, and Erlend Moe Riise. The show was created by Nikolaj Frobenius and Stephen Uhlander. The Lrenskog Disappearance, like “Saint X,” follows a seemingly unsolvable mystery, making it a fantastic show to watch after that.</p><h3>The Missing (2014-2016)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/maxresdefault-1.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The British anthology drama “The Missing,” which was created by Harry and Jack Williams, centres on the disappearance of Oliver, a five-year-old boy. Tony, Emily Hughes, and their son Ollie are the main characters in the story. The decision to take the happy family’s five-year-old kid on vacation causes everything to change. When their son inexplicably vanishes, a French police detective begins looking for the child. The case finally becomes unsolved, nevertheless, due to the lack of information and hints supporting the presence of the child.</p><p>However, 12 years later, the same retired French chief makes the decision to solve an intriguing riddle and locate the youngster, whom he still thinks is alive. James Nesbitt, Tchéky Karyo, Frances O’Connor, and Keeley Hawes are among the cast members. Even without a sibling looking for the truth, “The Missing” examines a compelling search and yearning for answers similar to what was shown in “Saint X.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=udd1140edfbf6217e15587885b148698c><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>8 Captivating Shows Like Silo That Will Leave You Hooked</span></a><h3>Top of the Lake (2013-2017)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1521498168267-top-of-the-lake_16x9_1920x1080-1.jpg alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" width=512 height=273 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>‘Top of the Lake’ is another mystery drama with Elisabeth Moss, Gwendoline Christie, Nicole Kidman, Ewen Leslie, Tom Wright, Peter Mullan, and Alice Englert. It focuses on disappearances and a never-ending inquiry. The investigator investigating the puzzling disappearances and murders of young girls is the focus of the Jane Campion and Gerard Lee-created television series. The perfect show to binge after “Saint X” is “Top of the Lake,” which similarly has a dark crime with a female lead discovering the truth.</p><h3></h3><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="shows like saint x,shows similar to tell me a story,shows like st elsewhere,tv shows like all saints,shows like lucky star,shows similar to away,shows off sign,shows like worth it" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
