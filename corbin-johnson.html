Corbin went missing in July 2018.</p><p>A year after his disappearance, a man discovered Corbin’s remains in the woods. In July 2019, a man clearing in the woods found a body’s remains wrapped in a bag. The police took four days to link the remains to Corbin Johnson. Moreover, Corbin’s date of demise is recorded as 15 July 2019, which might be the day his body was discovered.</p><p>Jahreeka Sims and her friend were a few of the last people to see this personality alive. Corbin had told Sims via a FaceTime video call that he was at Amazon for a job interview. This late teenager also told Sims that he was waiting for a ride.</p><p>On the day of his disappearance, his father – Corey Morman – had dropped him off for another interview with UPS at 5 pm. Later, Corey picked him up 45 minutes later. After he left this late personality at his mother’s house at 8 pm, his mother last saw him at half past nine. After a failed combined search effort to locate this late teenager, search efforts went cold quickly.</p><p>Authorities classified this late teenager’s death as a homicide. Likewise, the authorities also called on the community to help solve the murder. As of December 2021, the police are yet to find the person guilty of this young teenager’s murder.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-238424 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Corbin-Johnsons-case-was-being-investigated-as-a-murder-case-in-2019.jpg alt="Corbin Johnson" width=650 height=366 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-238424 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Corbin’s case was being investigated as a murder case in 2019.
