This article delves into the fascinating story of Mike Tyson's tiger ownership, its impact, and the controversies surrounding it.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Mike Tyson's Infamous Tiger Ownership</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Mike Tyson's</a> ownership of three Bengal tigers named Kenya, Storm, and Boris garnered widespread attention and controversy. He obtained two of these tigers during his time in prison on rape charges in 1992, as reported by the Infobae portal. Tyson's ownership of these majestic yet endangered animals was extravagant, with each tiger costing $70,000 to own and an additional $200,000 in food, totaling over $1500 a day in tiger chow.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Controversies and Incidents</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Altercation with a Las Vegas Resident</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the most significant incidents related to Tyson's tiger ownership was an altercation with a Las Vegas resident, resulting in the loss of one of his tigers. According to <a href=#>Tysonâ€™s</a> former manager Shelley Finkel, Tyson had to get rid of one of his three tigers after an incident in his neighborhood. The tiger attempted to devour a neighbor's dog, prompting Tyson to part ways with one of his giant cats.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on Community and Neighbors</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>The incident involving Tyson's tiger attempting to eat a neighbor's dog shed light on the potential dangers of owning exotic animals. The situation raised concerns about the safety of the community and the well-being of the animals. Furthermore, the extravagant nature of the tiger ownership, including the substantial costs associated with caring for the tigers, sparked public debate and scrutiny.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Ethical and Legal Implications</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tyson's ownership of these exotic animals also raised ethical and legal questions. The incident with the neighbor's dog and the subsequent involvement of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) highlighted the ethical considerations surrounding keeping such powerful and potentially dangerous animals in captivity. Additionally, the legalities of owning and caring for endangered species came into question, especially in urban residential areas.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Tyson's Reflection on Tiger Ownership</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In a candid admission during an Instagram Live session with Fat Joe, Tyson expressed regret and acknowledged the folly of his tiger ownership. He admitted that he was "foolish" for keeping tigers at his Las Vegas residence, emphasizing that attempting to "domesticate" these cats was a mistake. Tyson confessed that he should never have had them in his house, recognizing the inherent risks and dangers associated with keeping wild animals as pets.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Aftermath and Current Situation</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Tyson</a> no longer owns the tigers, signifying a departure from his controversial venture into exotic animal ownership. At present, the former heavyweight champion has transitioned to more mainstream pets, such as a dog named Mars Tyson and a collection of pigeons, reflecting a shift away from the extravagant and potentially hazardous ownership of exotic animals.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Cultural Impact and Public Perception</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>"The Hangover" and Popular Culture</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Tyson's tigers were not only a part of his personal life but also became a major plot point in the 2009 movie "The Hangover." The film's incorporation of Tyson's tigers into its storyline contributed to the cultural significance and public fascination with Tyson's ownership of these exotic animals. This portrayal in popular culture further fueled the public's intrigue and curiosity about the former <a href=#>boxing</a> champion's unconventional choice of pets.</p><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Public Response and Social Media Memes</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>Netflix's documentary "Tiger King," which brought attention to the story of Joe Exotic, further stirred social media with thousands of memes and discussions about the world of big cat ownership. This widespread public response and the documentary's impact underscored the enduring fascination and controversy surrounding individuals who keep exotic animals, including figures like Mike Tyson.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The saga of Mike Tyson's tiger ownership serves as a cautionary tale about the complexities and implications of keeping exotic animals as pets, particularly in urban settings. From the extravagant costs and legal considerations to the ethical implications and potential risks, Tyson's experience with his tigers sheds light on the broader discourse surrounding the ownership of wild and endangered animals. Furthermore, his candid reflections and the cultural impact of his tiger ownership have sparked discussions about responsible animal stewardship and the ethical boundaries of human-animal interactions.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1><a href=#>Mike Tyson's</a> tiger ownership stands as a compelling and thought-provoking chapter in the story of the former boxing champion, offering valuable insights into the multifaceted issues surrounding exotic animal ownership and its impact on individuals, communities, and public perception.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miZqLCZo7Rww8eaq2agkaW9prrEnWSipl2itqyxjK2wrKeeqHq1tcaeqQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-in-mike-tysons-tiger.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-in-mike-tysons-tiger.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-in-mike-tysons-tiger.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-in-mike-tysons-tiger.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-in-mike-tysons-tiger.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-in-mike-tysons-tiger.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-pat-lund-married.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-pat-lund-married.html>Is Pat Lund Married?
