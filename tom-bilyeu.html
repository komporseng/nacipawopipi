He had to work hard to become one of the wealthiest men in the world today. Tom described himself as lazy and chubby prior to his fame and fortune. His weight loss inspired him to encourage others, including his obese family, to lose weight as well.

In 2010, he co-founded Quest Nutrition with his wife Lisa, Ron Penna, Shannan Pena, and Mike Osborne.</p><p>The company is well-known for its protein bars and chips, as well as its Quest protein powder.

Quest products had expanded to over 70 countries around the world, with over 40,000 distribution outlets. The company thrives on creating products that taste good while still providing the nutritional value that meals require. They have primarily been used for weight management and control.</p><p>Quest protein bars were later sold for $1 billion to Simply Good Foods Co.
