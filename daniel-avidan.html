In late 2003, Avidan joined their band as the lead singer and songwriter. Before splitting up in mid-2005, the band released one self-titled EP and one live track at World Café Live in Philadelphia.</p><p>Further, Dan teamed up with Peter Lennox in the winter of 2006, to bring together a Brooklyn-based alternative pop duo named, ‘Skyhill.’ Avidan took over the role of lead singer and songwriter once again. The duo released one full album, ‘Run with the Hunted, on May 16, 2007, and later, toured New York in 2008 before eventually separating due to creative differences.</p><p>After the failure of both the bands, The Northern Hues, and Skyhill, Avidan left no stone unturned to make his next band a success. He began searching for a producer and was introduced to Brian Wecht, who was the musical director of a comedy troupe in New York.</p><p>The introduction took place at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. In early 2009, the band, ‘Ninja Sex Party’ was formed with Avidan’s character being called Danny Sexbang and Wecht’s character as Brian Ninja. The band was about “a Jewish superhero who wears a unitard, with his best friend who’s a ninja” in Avidan’s own words.</p><p>The band has released three original albums, ‘NSFW’ (2011), ‘Strawberries and Cream (2013), and ‘Attitude City’ (2015).
